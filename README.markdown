# Strava Helper

**Firefox and Chrome versions of this extension have been merged. See [Strava Helper](https://github.com/mjaschen/strava-helper-firefox)**

This Chrome Add-on aims to provide some tweaks for the Strava Website.

## Give Kudos to All

A button in the upper left of every Strava page can be used to give Kudos to all visible activities.
It saves you a lot of time and your Strava friends get the little dose of motivation they deserve!

## UI Cleanup

- Removes some premium upselling and shop links
- Moves recent activities section from footer to sidebar (on dashboard only)

## Fixed Header

The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen.
